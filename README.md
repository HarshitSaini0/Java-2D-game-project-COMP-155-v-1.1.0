# Java 2D Game Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This documentation outlines the Java 2D Game Project, likely developed as part of a computer science course (indicated by "COMP-155"). It serves as a guide for developers, students, and contributors interested in the project's design and implementation.

While this document doesn't cover all features (due to lack of access to the full codebase), it offers a foundational understanding and reference for engaging with the project.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

To run and contribute to this project, ensure the following:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: A recent, stable version is recommended.
* **IDE**: Use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for easier development and debugging.
* **Dependencies**: If the project uses external libraries (e.g., for graphics or sound), instructions should be provided in the repository.

### 2.2 Downloading the Project

Clone the repository from GitHub using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshitSaini0/Java-2D-game-project-COMP-155-v-1.1.0
```

This creates a local copy named `Java-2D-game-project-COMP-155-v-1.1.0`.

### 2.3 Building the Game

Check for the presence of a build tool:

* **Gradle**: Look for `build.gradle` or `gradlew` files.

  * Run: `./gradlew build` (Linux/macOS) or `gradlew build` (Windows).
* **Maven**: Look for `pom.xml`.
* **Manual**: If no build tool is present, use your IDE to compile the `.java` files.

### 2.4 Running the Game

Once built, run the game via:

* **IDE**: Right-click the main class and select **Run**.
* **Command Line**:

  ```bash
  java [fully.qualified.MainClassName]
  ```

Refer to project documentation for the main class name or runtime arguments if required.

## 3. Game Features and Gameplay

### 3.1 Overview

The genre, setting, and objectives of the game are essential for understanding the gameplay. These could include:

* **Genres**: Platformer, arcade, puzzle, etc.
* **Settings**: Fantasy, realistic, abstract.
* **Objectives**: Complete levels, defeat enemies, achieve high scores.

### 3.2 Core Mechanics

Key player actions may include:

* Movement (walk, run)
* Jumping
* Shooting or interacting with objects

If a physics engine is used, its behavior (gravity, collision) should be explained.

### 3.3 Controls

Example control mappings:

* **Keyboard**:

  * Arrow keys: Move
  * Spacebar: Jump
* **Mouse**:

  * Left-click: Attack
  * Move: Aim

Document gamepad support if applicable.

### 3.4 Game Elements

Common elements may include:

* **Player**: Controlled by the user.
* **Enemies**: Various types with behaviors.
* **Items**: Boosts, power-ups, or collectibles.
* **Obstacles**: Environmental challenges.
* **Levels**: Unique maps or stages.

Object interaction (e.g., item pickup) should also be explained.

### 3.5 Objectives and Goals

Goals may include:

* Reaching an endpoint
* Collecting items
* Defeating bosses
* Achieving high scores

These define the playerâ€™s purpose in the game.

### 3.6 Visuals

Include screenshots or video clips showing:

* UI
* Game levels
* Characters
* Animations

Visuals help users quickly understand the look and feel of the game.

## 4. Technical Documentation

### 4.1 Project Structure

A standard project layout might include:

```
/src        -> Java source files
/assets     -> Images, sounds, level data
/lib        -> External libraries (if any)
```

Describe the role of each directory for easier navigation.

### 4.2 Key Classes and Their Functions

| Class              | Description                 | Responsibilities                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `GamePanel`        | Main rendering panel        | Game loop, input handling, drawing to screen       |
| `Player`           | Player-controlled character | Movement, actions, collisions                      |
| `Enemy`            | AI-controlled character     | Movement patterns, interactions                    |
| `Level`            | Game level manager          | Loads levels, spawns entities, handles transitions |
| `CollisionHandler` | Manages collisions          | Collision detection and resolution                 |
| `InputHandler`     | Keyboard/mouse input        | Maps input events to game actions                  |
| `GraphicsEngine`   | Handles rendering           | Drawing sprites, UI, and backgrounds               |
| `SoundManager`     | Manages audio               | Loads and plays sound/music                        |

If additional classes handle special computations or shaders, describe them here.

### 4.3 Key Packages

Example package organization:

* `entities`: Player, enemy, NPC classes
* `ui`: Menu screens, HUD elements
* `utils`: Helpers and reusable functions

Each package should serve a clear purpose in the codebase.

### 4.4 Design Patterns Used

Mention any major patterns such as:

* **Singleton**: For global managers like `SoundManager`
* **Factory**: For creating enemies or levels
* **Observer**: For event-driven behavior (e.g., score updates)

Explain why and how these patterns are used.

### 4.5 External Libraries

If the project uses third-party tools:

* **LWJGL**: For low-level rendering/audio
* **libGDX or Slick2D**: For 2D game abstraction
* **Other libraries**: Must be listed with installation/setup instructions

### 4.6 Core Game Loop

A standard loop includes:

1. **Input handling**
2. **Game state update**
3. **Rendering**

Explain where and how this is implemented (typically in `GamePanel` or `Main` class).
